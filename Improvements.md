# Depth-search

## implemented:
- removes usage of deepcopy, x5 speedup
- Lookahead implemented, is awesome.

## to implement:


# Breadth-search

## Implemented:

itself

## to implement:
- beam-search


# Pruning methods

## Implemented:

## To implement:
- Check max score achievable, abort if lower than best.
- prune mirrored version, x2 speedup?

# Heuristics

## To implement
- Compactness / amount of folds/ uitgerektness.
- lost points by saturated aminos.


# Ideas.

- Return ALL best chains. to compare
- Instead of creating the matrix and score from scratch for every chain with a single new amino, take the score and matrix from the last chain, and append the new amino to the matrix and score.



# TODO
- Breadth search
- Max achievable score function.
