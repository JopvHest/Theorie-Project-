# How to use (main.py).
1. Create a new protein by .....

2. Call a algorithm function like ....
see algorithmes for the algos available

3. Get output from the protein by using one of the follwoing functions:
- get_score()
- get_protein()
- get_output()

# Classes

    ## Protein()
    ## Amino()
    ## Chain()

# Algorithmes?

    ## Depth search first
        ### Lookahead
        ### Iterative
    ## Branch bound
        ### Lookahead
        ### Random throwaway
    ## Breadth_search
        ### Beam search
    ## iterative
        ### Hill climbing


# Functions
    ## Get_score()
    ## Get_matrix()
    ## is_chain_3d()
    ## chain_can_reach_spots

# Heuristics/pruning
    ## Pruning
        ### Ignore mirror
        ### Brand and bound
        ### Force first move
    ## Heuristics
        ### c-h score
        ### Compactness
        ### Current score (< or > than average and or best.)

# What could be improved / Where to go from here
- improve function x by x
- improbe function x by x
- try x heuristics
- add x pruning

# What we could have done better.
- Idk, class / function absctracting could be better??
